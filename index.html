        <h3>What Makes It Great</h3>
        <div class="all-pics">
            <p><img src="../../odin-links-and-images/images/landing-page-music.jpg" alt="Image of ABBA on a guitar" width="100" height="100">Music: The movie recreates many of ABBA's most famous songs, resulting in a plot which is enhanced by various upbeat, emotional, and comedic songs.</p>
            <p><img src="../../odin-links-and-images/images/landing-page-setting.jpg" alt="Greek buildings on the seaside" height="100" width="100">Setting: Taking place in a small island off of Greece, the mvoie's setting features blue seas, beautiful Greek architecture, and plenty of scenic shots.</p>
            <p><img src="../../odin-links-and-images/images/landing-page-humor.jpg" alt="Neon sign that says laugh" height="100" width="100">Humor: It's tried and true that this movie is perfect for all ages. Innuendos will surely entertain those old enough to understand them, while leaving those too young innocent but still enamored by the vibrant sounds and sights of the movie.</p>
            <p><img src="../../odin-links-and-images/images/landing-page-cast.jpg" alt="Chair that says cast" height="100" width="100">Cast: Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Dominic Cooper. What more needs to be said?</p>
